PMW Snow Depth Assimilation Over Alaska Public Testcase
=======================================================


Introduction
============

This test-case performs assimilation of bias-corrected (against SNOTEL and 
GHCN station data with optimal interpolation) ANSA snow depth
at 0.05 degree over Alaska with Noah.3.3 and NAM 242 forcing from 
2011-03-01 to 2011-05-31 to test the data assimilation plug-in "PMW snow",
which is implemented as a general reader for assimilating PWM snow depth
or SWE data (AMSR-E, ANSA, SMMR, SSMI). 

PMW-based SWE or snow depth retrievals can contain larger errors.
Hence it only makes sense to assimilate the products that are pre-processed 
to correct or account for the bias via methods like station data-based 
bias correction, model-based CDF matching or anomaly assimilation. 

This test case illustrates the assimilation of bias corrected ANSA
snow depth data. Capabilities for model-based CDF matching and anomaly 
assimilation will be implemented and illustrated with new test cases later.


This directory contains: 

* this README file.
* the ldt.config file used for LDT in this test case. 
  (This file should be edited to make sure that the locations of the 
  parameter and forcing files are specified correctly.) 
* a sample grads control file used to specify the LDT output/LIS input
  parameters (input.ctl)
* the lis.config.ol and lis.config.da files used for LIS openloop and DA runs
* the MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL file used to specify the LIS output variables.
* sample grads control files that can be used to visualize the 
  output. (output.ol.ctl and output.da.ctl)
* a sample grads control file that can be used to visualize the 
  test case output. (testcase.ol.ctl and testcase.da.ctl)


Preparation
===========

  #. Generate the LDT and the LIS executables.

  #. Create a directory to run LDT and LIS within (a directory outside
     of the LIS source code).  Copy the contents of this testcase
     sub-directory into this new running directory.  And then change
     directories into this new running directory.

  #. Go into the "input" sub-directory and make the "wget" .sh
     scripts be executable.


Running the testcase
====================

LDT
---

  #. Go into the "input" sub-directory and do the following:

     * download input parameters ::

       ./wget_lisnoahparms_portal.sh
       ./wget_nam242parms_portal.sh

  #. Change directory back to the running directory (i.e.; ``cd ..``)
     and run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file.

LIS
---

  #. Go into the "input" sub-directory and do the following:

     * download Noah 3.3 specific parameter tables ::

       ./wget_noah33parms_portal.sh
       
     * download Noah 3.3 restart file ::
        
       ./wget_lisrestart_portal.sh

     * download NAM242 meteorological forcing data ::

       ./wget_nam242_portal.sh

     * download ANSA snow depth data for assimilation ::

       ./wget_ansa_oi_portal.sh

  #. Change directory back to the running directory (i.e.; ``cd ..``)

  #. First run the open loop scenario by running the LIS executable
     using the lis.config.ol file.

  #. Then run the data assimilation scenario by running the LIS executable
     using the lis.config.da file.

  #. View the netCDF output using the testcase GrADS ctl files


Sample Output
=============

To download sample output for comparison, make sure that you are in the
running directory.  Then execute ::

   ./wget_output_portal.sh

This will download and unpack the sample output into the "OUTPUT"
directory along side the output that you generated.

From Logan Karsten:

| The naming convention of the FTP directory is as follows - 
| ftp://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/SL.us008001/ST.opnl/MT.nam_AR.ak_CY.00/RD.20120924/PT.grid_DF.gr2/fh.0024_tl.press_gr.awp242 
| where "MT.nam_AR.ak_CY.00" represents the NAM 242 00Z Cycle, "RD.20120924" 
| represents the date of the model run, and "fh.0024_tl.press_gr.awp242" is the 
| actual GRIB2 file for forecast hour 24 of NAM 242.


Caveats
=======

Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
from the testcase is not expected to be used for any scientific 
evaluation.
