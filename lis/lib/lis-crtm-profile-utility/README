Profile_Utility library build instructions
==========================================

0) There are options for specific compilers. The available compilers are:
     ibm
     gfortran[linux]
     lahey[linux]
     pgi[linux]
     g95[linux]
     sgi           (untested)
     sun           (untested)
     intel[linux]  (untested)

   The actual compiler and switch definitions are listed in the "make.macros" files.
   Also note that not all of the above compilers have been tested using their latest
   release.

   The build is OS-sensitive in that the compiler is selected based on the platform
   you are one. For example, if you build on an IBM/AIX system, the xlf95 compiler
   is invoked. Doing the same on a linux or MacOSX system invokes the default linux
   compiler; currently this is the Gnu gfortran f95 compiler.

   So, if you want to modify how the library builds (different compiler, different
   switches) editing the "make.macros" file is, for now, your best best.
   Eventually we'll put together something smarter.

   For the linux folks out there, the bottom of the "make.macros" file contains
   the following
     LINUX_FLAGS = $(LINUX_FLAGS_GFORTRAN)
     #LINUX_FLAGS = $(LINUX_FLAGS_LAHEY)
     #LINUX_FLAGS = $(LINUX_FLAGS_PGI)
     #LINUX_FLAGS = $(LINUX_FLAGS_INTEL)
     #LINUX_FLAGS = $(LINUX_FLAGS_G95)
   If you want to change the default linux compiler simply comment out the gfortran
   definition line and uncomment the compiler definition of your choice.


1) Once all the above stuff has been sorted out, to build the Profile_Utility library type

     make


2) To install the Profile_Utility library in ./lib and ./include directories, type

     make install


3) To run the test codes, type

     make test
     
   This will generate a bunch of output to screen that you can inspect to see what the
   differences are. Keep in mind that differetn compiler switches and optimisations may
   produce different results from any baseline data stored with the tests.
   
   
4) That's really it. Any questions, suggestions, additions, bug reports, etc,
   let me know know at
