Focus:  Noah LSM Native Parameters with 'Filling' 
      Options Turned On

Description:  This test case involves the processing
      of 'Native' 2-D Noah LSM parameters obtained from the 
      original NCEP and NCAR institution source websites
      and ensures mask-parameter consistency by turning on
      fill options for each parameter so the output could
      be used in an actual LIS run. 

This test case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file;
  (b) the wget data download scripts:
    wget_gtopo30_native.sh, wget_noah2dparms_native.sh, wget_noah33_output.sh

  (c) the ldt.config input file to LDT used for this testcase;
  (d) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output;
  (e) and to compare with output data, download the original output
       tar-zipped file, unpack and compare with those given files.

To run this test case: 
 
  (a) Run the download script in a working directory where you want 
       to place the Noah 2-D input data:

       sh wget_noah2dparms_native.sh
       sh wget_gtopo30_native.sh

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy it to your working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file,  
       and the Noah 2-D input parameters.  To run, type:

      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file,
       test_output.xdf, or the ncview executable (if you have 
       it installed).

  (e) Download and unpack the LDT test case output data to compare with
       by running the final script:

       sh wget_noah33_output.sh

      Then unpack the original output files with:

       tar -xzvf Public-LDT_Noah33_output_v71.tar.gz

Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
