Focus:  NLDAS-2 Forcing Dataset Processing

Description:  This test case involves the processing
      of NLDAS-2 forcing data obtained from the 
      NASA GES-DISC and generated onto domain over
      Mid-Atlantic U.S.

This test case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the wget data download scripts: 
     wget_gesdisc_nldas2.sh
     wget_nldas2forc_output.sh
  (c) the ldt.config input file used with LDT for this testcase;
  (d) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output;
  (e) and to compare with output data, download the original output
       tar-zipped file, unpack and compare with those given files.

To run this test case: 
 
  (a) Run the download scriptsin a working directory where you want 
       to place the NLDAS-2 input data:

       sh wget_nldasparms_portal.sh

      and output files from the original NLDAS2 files to compare with:

       sh wget_nldas2forc_output.sh

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to local working directory. 

  (c) Run the LDT executable with the ldt.config file, 
       and generate the NLDAS-2 forcing output for a selected domain.

      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file or
       the ncview executable (if you have it installed).

  (e) Download and unpack the LDT test case output data by running the script
       and untar/unpack using the command:

     tar -xzvf Public-LDT_NLDAS2_Metforc_output_v71.tar.gz
 
     To view the original output, a grads xdf control file has been provided
      in this directory:  orig_output.xdf


Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
