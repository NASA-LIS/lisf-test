Focus:  Native PRISM Precipitation Climatology Parameters

Description:  This test case involves the processing
      of PRISM precipitation climatology parameters.

This test case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the wget data download scripts:  
    wget_prism_clim_portal.sh
    wget_gdasparms_portal.sh
    wget_nldasparms_portal.sh
    wget_prism_clim_portal.sh
    wget_prism_output.sh
  (c) the ldt.config input file to LDT used for this testcase;
  (d) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output;
  (e) and to compare with output data, download the original output
       tar-zipped file, unpack and compare with those given files.

To run this test case: 
 
  (a) Run the download scripts in a working directory where you want 
       to place the PRISM precipitation climatology input data and the
       GDAS and NLDAS2 forcing elevation files.

      sh wget_prism_clim_portal.sh
      sh wget_gdasparms_portal.sh
      sh wget_nldasparms_portal.sh

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy it to your working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file,  
       and the PIRSM 2-D input parameters.  To run, type:
      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file, test_output.xdf,  
       or the ncview executable (if you have it installed).

  (e) Download and unpack the LDT test case output data using the script:

      sh wget_prism_output.sh
      tar -xzvf Public-LDT_PRISM_output_v71.tar.gz

      to compare with what you produced with these test case files. 

Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
