Focus:  NLDAS-2 Forcing Elevation Parameter Processing

Description:  This test case involves the processing
      of NLDAS-2 elevation parameters obtained from the 
      original USGS institution source website.

This test case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the wget data download scripts:  wget_nldasparms_portal.sh;
  (c) the ldt.config input file used with LDT for this testcase;
  (d) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output;
  (e) and to compare with output data, download the original output
       tar-zipped file, unpack and compare with those given files.

To run this test case: 
 
  (a) Run the download script in a working directory where you want 
       to place the NLDAS-2 input data:

       sh wget_nldasparms_portal.sh

  (b) Generate and copy your LDT executable to your working directory. 

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file, 
       and the NLDAS-2 forcing elevation parameters.  
       To run, type:

      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file or
       the ncview executable (if you have it installed).

  (f) Download and unpack the output LDT test case output data by running
       the wget script:  sh wget_nldas2elev_output.sh

Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
