Focus:  Native SRTM-30 Elevation Parameter

Description:  This test case involves the processing
      of 'Native' SRTM30 elevation parameters obtained from the 
      original USGS institution source website

This test case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the wget data download scripts: 
    wget_mod44wmask_portal.sh, wget_srtm30_native.sh, wget_srtm30_outputfiles.sh 

  (c) the ldt.config input file to LDT used for this testcase;
  (d) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output;
  (e) and to compare with output data, download the original output
       tar-zipped file, unpack and compare with those given files.

To run this test case: 
 
  (a) Run the download script in a working directory where you want 
       to place the SRTM30 tiled elevation input data:

     sh wget_mod44wmask_portal.sh
     sh wget_srtm30_native.sh

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to your working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file,  
       and the Noah 2-D input parameters.  To run, type:

      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file,
       test_output.xdf, or the ncview executable (if you have 
       it installed).

  (e) Download and unpack the LDT test case output data by running
       the script:

      sh wget_srtm30_outputfiles.sh

     then unpack the output files by:
      tar -xzvf Public-LDT_SRTM30_output_v71.tar.gz 

Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
