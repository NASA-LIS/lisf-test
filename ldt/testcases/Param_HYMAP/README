Focus:  HYMAP Routing Scheme Parameters

Description:  This test case involves the processing
      of HYMAP routing parameters.

This test case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the wget data download scripts:  
   wget_hymap_outputfiles.sh
   wget_hymaproutingparms_portal.sh
   wget_lisumdlc_portal.sh
  (c) the ldt.config input file to LDT used for this testcase;
  (d) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output;
  (e) and to compare with output data, download the original output
       tar-zipped file, unpack and compare with those given files.

To run this test case: 
 
  (a) Run the download script in a working directory where you want 
       to place the HYMAP tiled routing input data:

       sh wget_hymaproutingparms_portal.sh
       sh wget_lisumdlc_portal.sh

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to your working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file,  
       and the HYMAP 2-D input parameters.  To run, type:
      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file, test_output.xdf, 
       or the ncview executable (if you have it installed).

  (e) Download and unpack the LDT test case output data with running the script:
       sh wget_hymap_outputfiles.sh

      To compare your generated LDT output files with the original files.

Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
