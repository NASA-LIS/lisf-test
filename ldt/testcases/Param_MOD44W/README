Focus:  Imposing or Filling Native MODIS-IGBP (NCEP) Landcover
         with the MODIS 44w Landmask

Description:  This test case involves the processing
      of 'Native' MODIS-IGBP landcover parameter obtained from 
      the original NCEP institution source website and imposing the
      LIS-produced MODIS 44w Landmask.

This test case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file;
  (b) the wget data download scripts: wget_mod44wmask_portal.sh, wget_modisigbp_ncep.sh
  (c) the ldt.config input file to LDT used for this testcase;
  (d) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output; 
  (e) and to compare with output data, download the original output
       tar-zipped file, unpack and compare with those given files.

To run this test case: 
 
  (a) Run the download scripts in a working directory where you want 
       to place the MODIS landcover and MOD44w landmask input data:

       sh wget_modisigbp_ncep.sh
       sh wget_mod44wmask_portal.sh

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy it to your local working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file,  
       which include the MODIS 44w landmask and MODIS landcover input parameters.  
      To run, type:

      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file, test_output.xdf, 
       or the ncview executable (if you have it installed).

  (e) Download and unpack the LDT test case output data with the script:

      sh wget_mod44w_outputfiles.sh
      tar -xzvf Public-LDT_MOD44W_output_v71.tar.gz

      to compare with the files generated in this test case.

Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
