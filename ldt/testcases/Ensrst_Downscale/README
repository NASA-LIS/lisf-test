Focus:  Downscaling Ensemble Restart File to Single Member Restart File

Description:  This test case involves the downscaling or generating a single-member
     restart file from a ensemble-member restart file.


This test case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the wget data download scripts: 
     wget_lisumdlc_portal.sh, wget_ensrst_downscale_testfiles.sh
  (c) the ldt.config input file used by LDT for this testcase
  (d) the input ensemble-member LIS-generated restart file:
        LIS_RST_NOAH33_201212312330.d01.nc
  (e) and to compare with output data, download the original output
       tar-zipped file, unpack and compare with those given files.

To run this test case: 
 
  (a) Run the download scripts in a working directory where you want 
       to place the landcover input data (mask will be created):

       sh wget_lisumdlc_portal.sh
       sh wget_ensrst_downscale_testfiles.sh

    -- Input files should be written to the directory named:  "./input"

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to your working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable with the provided ldt.config file by typing:
      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using a tool, like
       the ncview executable (if you have it installed).

  (e) Unpack the downloaded ensemble restart testcase original output: 

       tar -xzvf Public-LDT_Ensrst_Downscale_output_v71.tar.gz

      which you can compare with what you produced with these test case files. 
      The files include:  noens_orig.nc, ldtlog.0000, MaskParamFill.log 

Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
