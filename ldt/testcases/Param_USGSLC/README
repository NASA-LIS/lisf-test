Focus:  Imposing or Filling Native USGS Landcover

Description:  This test case involves the processing
      of 'Native' USGS landcover parameter obtained from USGS

This test case uses the following files:
  (a) this README file
  (b) the wget data download scripts:
    wget_USGSLC_native.sh
    wget_usgslc_output.sh
  (c) the ldt.config input file to LDT used for this testcase;
  (d) test_output.xdf GrADS control file to view the LDT-generated output;
  (e) and to compare with output data, download the original output
       tar-zipped file, unpack and compare with those given files.

To run this test case: 
 
  (a) Run the download script in a working directory where you want 
       to place the USGS landcover input data:

       sh wget_usgslc_native.sh

  (b) Generate the LDT executable and copy to your working directory.

  (c) Run the LDT executable using the ldt.config file 
       and the USGS landcover input parameter.  To run type:
      ./LDT ldt.config

  (d) View the NetCDF (*.nc) output using the sample grads file,
       test_output.xdf, or the ncview executable (if you have it installed).

  (e) Download and unpack the LDT test case output data by running:

       sh wget_usgslc_output.sh

      and compare against the original output files.

Caveats: 
  (a) Please note that this is a more basic functional test for purpose
      of learning major LDT features.
